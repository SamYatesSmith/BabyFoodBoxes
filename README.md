  - Visually pleasing underline upon hover that slowly fades.

* **Our Story**
  - This fully responsive page offers various information about the prospective company.  A full background, an insight into what the future holds once HBB trades and detailed look into the hopes to be apply to supply customers produce within a 10 mile radius of their homes. 
  - The page comprises of numerous photos of HBB's network of farmers, happily going about their business.  These HQ images are initially laid in a block stance and change to a horizontal grid upon re-sizing.
  - There are links around the page built into the text.  These offer easier navigation to the usr and are styled in the same way as the navigation bars links, to ensure subtle continuity around the site.

* **Products**
  - The product page gives example recipes to the potential user and a small inserted autoplaying, looped video showing a typical family. The page is fully responsive and, upon resizing, unearths an image that would otherwise be hidden owing to the screen size.
  - With more time and the allowed use of javascript, i intended to add a pop up upon hover for the 3 day, 5 day, 7 day boxes.  This would give the user the opportunity to see the typical inclusions within a HBB box for these package sizes.
 
* **Interested**
  - 'Interested?' is the customer user form.  This form compiles data from the user regarding name, surname, email and county in which one lives, via a drop down bar.
  - Primarily the form comprises of radio, checkboxes and text areas.
  - Also within this page is a photo whose radius changes upon resize.
  - Again, this page is fully responsive to screen size changes.
 
* **Features left to implement**
  - I would like to add havascript corusel to the various groups of photos on the pages.  This would free up space and offer more functionality.
  - The javascript pop up alerts for the typical ingredient boxes would be a nice user feature to add (as stated above in "interested" section.
  - The final question on the form mentions a project which i would like to build and associate with this site.
  - Proper favicon on the web browser heading.
 
**Testing**
  - All links, buttons and resizing work as intended.  No obvious eerors or issues with the code.
  - The main issue is with an @import font trnsfer that "codeAnywhere" throws up a yellow warning for. I am unsure as to why this is currently occuring.
  - As of time of writing, i have no server to submit form data to.  I have therefore submitted to the following: https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/". I am unsure however of how to check the recieved data to ensure its quality and validity.
  - I addressed numerous issues in relation to position of elements upon re-sizing.  These were all successfully resolved.  However, if more time were available, i would address issues where at extremely large screen size, the images distort and become too large in comparison with the other elements of the site.
  - HTML validator shows numerous info insights on elements such as img's or link's ending with the follwoing />.  I remove, save and they all return. Assume this is owing to an extension adding them.
  - I was unable to use my own pre-built favicon as I wa suncertain of how to size correctly and could not therefore find the time to make it work.

**Validator Testing**
  - HTML testing. No major errors. Barring info suppositions as mentioned in testing and this further affects images.  Minor errors resolved 
  - CSS testing. No errors found.
