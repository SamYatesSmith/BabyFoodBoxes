### Our Story

- This fully responsive page offers various information about the prospective company. A full background, an insight into what the future holds once HBB trades and a detailed look into local suppliers hoping to offer their produce to a local market.

- The page comprises of numerous photos of HBB's network of farmers, happily going about their business. These HQ images are initially presented in a block stance and change to a horizontal grid upon re-sizing.
- There are links around the page built into the text. These offer easier navigation to the user and are styled in the same way as the navigation bar links, to ensure subtle continuity around the site.

### Products

- The product page gives example recipes to the potential user and a small inserted autoplaying, controllable, looped video showing a typical family.

<img src="https://github.com/SamYatesSmith/BabyFoodBoxes/blob/main/assets/images/README%20images/video.png">

- The page is fully responsive and, upon resizing, unearths an image that would otherwise be hidden owing to the screen size.
- With more time and the allowed use of javascript, I intended to add a pop up upon hover for the 3 day, 5 day, 7 day boxes. This would give the user the opportunity to see the typical inclusions within a HBB box for these package sizes.

### Interested

- 'Interested?' is the customer user form. 
- This form compiles data from the user regarding name, surname, email and county in which one lives, via a drop down bar.

<img src="https://github.com/SamYatesSmith/BabyFoodBoxes/blob/main/assets/images/README%20images/basicinfoform.png">

- Primarily the form comprises of radio, checkboxes and text areas.
- Also within this page is a photo, whose radius changes upon resize.
- Again, this page is fully responsive to screen size changes.

## Features left to implement

- I would like to add a Javascript carousel to the various groups of photos on the pages. This would free up space, offer more functionality and provide a more succinct message.
- The javascript pop up alerts for the typical ingredient boxes would be a nice user feature to add (as stated above in "Interested?" section.)
- The final question on the form mentions a project which I would like to build and link to this site. ("The Checker, By Edible" is a further project created on my github page: https://github.com/SamYatesSmith/IA-Menu-Checker.git)
- Proper favicon HBB icon on the web browser heading.

## Testing

- All links, buttons and resizing work as intended. No obvious errors or issues with the code.
- I addressed numerous issues in relation to position of elements upon re-sizing. These were all successfully resolved. However,  I meed to address issues where at extremely large screen size, the images distort and become too large in comparison with the other elements of the site.
- Carried out various "User"/"Developer" story considerations:

1. As a user, I want to easily navigate through the website, so that I can find the information I need about Happy Baby Belly's products and story. 
- Action: Allow clickable styled navigational links to allow easy access to the various pages within the site. 

2. As a user, I want to understand the purpose of the website from the title and tagline, so that I can quickly determine if it meets my needs.
- Provide an obvious, styled heading with the company name a short tagline providing information about the site and business.

3. As a user, I want to learn more about Happy Baby Belly's story by clicking on the 'Our Story' link, so that I can feel connected to the brand and its mission.
- Action: Provide clear and concise stories relating to the business and its offerings withi nthe page "Our Story".  Style around various images with the supposition that these images are local farmers eagerly providing food for their local communities.

4. As a user, I want to view the available products by clicking on the 'Products' link, so that I can explore the options for feeding my baby.
- Action: Allow page area for users to check out what HBB offers its customers. Ensure this is neatly, simply presented and provides examples of the type of products to be available.

5. As a user, I want to express interest in Happy Baby Belly's service by filling out the form on the 'Interested?' page, so that I can enquire further about their offerings.
- Provide a short questionnaire which both peaks the users interest in the product and provides valuable data about the structure within which the business will need to operate.

6. As a user, I want to access the company's social media profiles, so that I can stay updated on news and promotions.
- Action: Provided clear clickable links of the companies logos which, if the business were active, would take the user to the various respectable social media home pages.

7. As a user, I want to easily contact Happy Baby Belly by clicking on the 'Contact' button in the footer, so that I can ask questions or provide feedback.
- Action: Provide a clear "Contact" button which opens up the users email provider with the target company email address already listed ready for the user to enquire. 

### Derveloper considerations

1. As a developer, I want to ensure that the website is responsive across different devices, so that users can access it comfortably on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
- Action:  Initiated various media queries to satisfy varrying screen sizes.

2. As a developer, I want to optimize the website's meta tags for search engines, so that it ranks well and attracts more organic traffic.
- Action: Wrote numerous "content" tags to guide traffic via SEO.

3. As a developer, I want to refactor the code to improve its readability and maintainability, so that future updates and enhancements can be implemented smoothly.
- Action: Listed comments headers to allow for simple perusal. Carefully selected class ad ID names to ensure there is an obvious link to the content within the class/ID.
