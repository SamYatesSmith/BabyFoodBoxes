            <p class="about-text">
                Established during the COVID pandemic, where time seemed endless, "Happy Baby Belly" is a simple concept. We
                prepare your babies meals based on their preferences and your available time to prepare the meals our boxed
                ingredients offer.
                Our <a href="#ingredients">ingredients</a> are all locally sourced to wherever you live. We achieve this
                with our wide network of suppliers, whom all benefit from our mission of ensuring our children eat
                wholesome, organic and tasty food.
                We first started HBB after performing a text on a well known pouched product which was listed as 'baby
                food'. What we found worried us as the trace vitamins and minerals all our babies need to grow big and
                strong were in incredibly short supply.
                We therefore decided upon a plan of action with the solitary goal of encouraging parents to prepare their
                own babies food in the hope that hey both enjoyed the process and found it easier owing to our freshly
                prepared ingredients and simple to follow preparation instructions.
                We proud to say that thus far, we've succeeded. We hope, with your help, to continue to do so.
            </p>

            <p class="future-text">
                All our food is lovingly prepared. Our food will always be so. That is our primary future pledge. The
                assurance for this comes from our desire to support local producers in your area. We essentially hope to
                achieve this by offering our local suppliers an alternative to the meager rates they receive from large
                retailers.
                We believe in our pledge and are dedicated to ensuring parents nationwide are confident in their childs'
                diet.
