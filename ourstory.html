            <p class="about-text">
                "Happy Baby Belly" is a simple concept. We prepare your babies meals based on their preferences and your available time to prepare the meals our boxed
                ingredients offer.  Our <a href="#ingredients">ingredients</a> are all locally sourced to wherever you live. We achieve this
                with our growing network of suppliers, whom all benefit from our mission of ensuring our children eat
                wholesome, organic and tasty food.
                We first started HBB after performing a test on a well known 'pouched' food product which was listed as 'baby
                food'. What we found worried us as desirable vitamins and minerals all our babies need to grow big and
                strong were in incredibly short supply.
                We therefore decided upon a plan of action with the goal of encouraging parents to prepare their
                own babies food in the hope that they both enjoy the process and find it easier owing to our freshly
                prepared ingredients and simple to follow preparation instructions.

                All our food is lovingly prepared. Our food will always be so. That is our primary future pledge. The
                assurance for this comes from our desire to support local producers in your area. We essentially hope to
                achieve this by offering our local suppliers an alternative to the meager rates they receive from large
                retailers.
                We believe in our pledge and are dedicated to ensuring parents nationwide are confident in their childs'
                diet.

            </div>
            <p class="ingredients-text">
                As we have discussed in our <a href="#about">about</a> section at the top of the page, we source all
                ingredients within a set radius of your address. Our clever software allows us to automate the customer
                request and furthermore, automate the delivery process after the box you purchase is packaged and shipped.
                This means that our carbon footprint is minimal - we wont lie and say we are "net zero" as we don't pay to
                offset the carbon we do produce, rather we prefer to keep this carbon output as low as it can possibly be in
                the hope that our customers appreciate that we are supporting local farmers and wholesalers, rather than
                driving our produce
                around the country and then pretending not to be creating carbon by simply offsetting its use.
                Our boxes are seasonal so our custom are aware that they are unable to eat produce that is not grown close
                to their homes, therefore your offerings are relative to what is grown within a certain radius of your home.
                We are against flying produce from the other side of the world as this goes against our aforementioned goal
                of managing our output and supporting local wholesalers.
